Increasing sales is the goal of any business. From digital startup founders to executives in large e-commerce companies. Everyone is looking for ways how to make more money. Yet, people often don't know where to start looking for conversion rate optimisation.

In a jungle of collected customer statistics, businesses are often unsure how to use the information. The analysis the influencing factors for an improved conversion KPI are not straightforward.

## What is a conversion rate?

For every business, the understanding of a conversion rate can be different. In e-commerce, this is often related to online sales. Then it calculates as the ratio of visitors versus purchasers. A company focussing on content looks rather at form submissions or newsletter subscriptions. Here, the conversion rate is a ratio of site visitors compared to actual submissions.

## Decide on the optimisation KPI

Therefore, the first step for engaging in optimisation is creating clarity what conversion rate is important for you. Only then, you will be able to take specific measures based on the right data. To keep it simple, I will distinguish between a pure product-focused and a content-focused business to explain the differences. Obviously, optimising content-related and form conversion rates may also apply to the e-commerce business.

Thus, let's assume:
- The E-Commerce business wants to optimise its e-commerce conversion rate (purchases vs. visitors)
- The content-driven business wants to optimise its contact form submission rate (submissions vs. visitors)

## Conversion rate optimisation

After defining the optimisation KPI, it is now time to explore how to improve it.

### E-Commerce conversion rate optimisation

In E-Commerce, the products displayed on the site should be a focus point when looking for optimisations. Products are shown in recommendation sliders, on category lister pages, on search result pages, on detail pages, on the basket page and ultimately in the order summary. The type of products shown will ultimately influence the purchase decision of the user. The more relevant the product gets, the more likely the customer will buy it. But how is relevancy defined?

In the following, I'll give an overview of different website page types and their specific relevancy KPIs.

#### Homepage

Here, you could include sliders with relevant products. Generally, new products, sale products and bestsellers are working well. To improve the relevance to the user even more, products with the favourite colour or from the gender of the customer could be shown. Other common practices are showing last clicked products or products from the last clicked category. The precondition is that this data is available via a user profile or in the session.

How to measure this? This can only be done by implementing a custom tracking event on the product sliders. Then this could be used to get something like a homepage slider usage rate = homepage slider clicks / no. homepage visitors. Optimising this KPI via the above measures will ultimately improve the e-commerce conversion rate.

### Form submission rate optimisation

All changes made to a digital channel like a website will ultimately have an effect on the 
Examples for overall to be optimised KPIs are:

- Overall exit rate (%)
- Overall bounce rate (%)
- Overall form completion rate (%)
- Overall download rate (%)
- Overall scroll interaction rate (%)

There could be smaller goals in between which could be achieved to support the bigger, more strategic KPIs. 



Define what is the goal of the digital channel / the business? -> based on that focus more on one or another of the following points

## General site metric optimisation

Drop of rate, exit rate, scroll interaction rate, form submission rate

## E-Commerce site optimisation

Conversion optimisation for e-commerce: onsite search optimisation via analytics, navigation lister page optimisation
