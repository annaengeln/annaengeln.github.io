## The search conference

The Mix-Camp E-Commerce search is an "informal one-day event to bring together experts of different backgrounds - such as IT, product managers, UX designers, search managers, information retrieval specialists, data scientists, search engine vendors - to discuss challenges, ideas, best practices, and case studies in the e-commerce search domain." (see: [MICES](https://mices.co/mices2020/index.html)).

At the time I was working as Senior Search Consultant at foryouandyourcustomers. On the conference, I used my many years of experience in the field of onsite search and merchandising to talk about the challenge for companies to provide a conclusive e-commerce search. This comprises understanding constantly changing customer requirements and translating them to a holistic solution consisting of channels, organisation, processes, systems and data.
