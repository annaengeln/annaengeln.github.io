## Install the basic Google Analytics package

This can already collect a lot of insights about the end users of a website: 
- Which input channels does the website have?
- Which pages are called up how often?
- From which countries and cities do the users come?
- Which devices do the users use?

Based on your frontend template, you can implement this by simply adding the standard GA JavaScript snippet to the page. In Google Analytics 4, the steps are the following:
1. Create a new GA4 account
2. Create a new data stream (probably "Web") within your newly created account
3. Copy the general website tag (gtag.js) which is coming up on your GA4 screen
4. Paste it into the <head> tag of your website, ideally on all pages

## Analyse the data

Now some insights can already be gained:
- How can the user experience on the website be improved?
- How can users be kept on the site longer? 

In the end, the insights also help to improve the conversion rate for an online business.

## Track advanced actions

If you want to track button clicks, form completions or downloads, for example, a developer should support you with this. After successful implementation, more specific insights into your user behaviour can then be gained, thus sustainably increasing sales and customer loyalty.
